This directory contains the materials needed to create the IMDB schema, used a lot in this course.
The data directory has a zipped schema export (see assignments for installation details).
Schema_Structure has three IMDB just table creation exports (for representation comparison).
We also have a png of the imdb_ijs schema, to ease use.

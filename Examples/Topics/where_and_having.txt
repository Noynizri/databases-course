# As a simple recommendation
# Where should be used to filter raw records
# Having should be used after grouping (and possible use of where), based on aggregation functions.

# As you can see below, more uses are possible.
# PLEASE IGNORE AND AVOID THEM.


# Where - Regular filtering of raw records
select *
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
where year = 1990
;


# Having - regular filtering of raw records works BUT BETTER NOT BE USED
select *
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
having year = 1990
;


# Having - filtering by an aggregation function
select year
, count(*) as cnt
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
group by year
having count(*) > 100 
;


# Having - filtering by an aggregation function AND RAW COLUMN - PLEASE DO NOT DO IT
select year
, count(*) as cnt
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
group by year
having count(*) > 100 and year = 1990
;


# FAIL - where cannot do filtering by an aggregation function
select year
, count(*) as cnt
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
where count(*) > 100
group by year
;

# Where - By using a subquery, the subquery aggregations are the raw records of the outer query
select *
from
(
select year
, count(*) as cnt
from 
imdb_ijs.movies
group by year ) as inSql
where cnt > 100
;

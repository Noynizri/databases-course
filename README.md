# Database for data analytics

This repository contains the learning materials of a "Database for data analytics" course.
The course teaches  
1. SQL language
2. Data quality
3. Data representation

The course uses the [IMDB](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/IMDB) movies database as the main schema.

The final project is a [movie recommendation system](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/recommendations_goldstandard) that the students build.

To learn the course, it is recommended to go over the [presentations](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/Presentations).
Each presentation has [examples](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/Examples) to run on MySql, which are most of the content.
There are also topic spcific eaxmples on table creation, normalization, etc.

There are exercises and example [exams and solutions](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/Exams%20and%20assignments), helping to evaluate student skill.
The [knowledgebase](https://github.com/evidencebp/databases-course/tree/main/KnowledgeBase) contains tips on using MySql and links to many related resources.
